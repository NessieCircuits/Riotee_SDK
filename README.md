# Riotee Software Development Kit

The code in this repository allows building applications that run on battery-free Riotee devices.
For a detailed description refer to the [documentation](https://www.riotee.nessie-circuits.de/).

For a quickstart with Riotee you can use our Arduino package which internally makes use of the SDK. For more involved projects, continue reading here.

## Installation

Download the [latest zip release](https://github.com/NessieCircuits/Riotee_SDK/releases/latest) and unpack it to a path on your machine.

Alternatively, clone this repository to get the latest development version of the SDK:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NessieCircuits/Riotee_SDK.git
```

### Linux

 - Install `make` from your distribution's repository (`apt install build-essential` on Ubuntu).
 - Install the *GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain* from your distribution's repository (`apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi` on Ubuntu) or from [the official website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
 - For uploading firmware to your Riotee device install the [riotee-probe](https://github.com/NessieCircuits/Riotee_ProbeSoftware) Python package with

```bash
pipx install riotee-probe
```

 - Download the [Riotee udev rules](https://github.com/NessieCircuits/Riotee_ProbeSoftware/blob/main/52-riotee.rules) and copy them to the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory on your machine.
 - Make sure your user belongs to the *plugdev* group and reload the udev rules with:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Windows
 - Install `make` via Cygwin or Chocolatey following the instructions [here](https://earthly.dev/blog/makefiles-on-windows/).
 - Add the path to `make`  (e.g. `C:/cygwin64/bin` for Cygwin) to your `Path` variable ([Instructions](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)).
 - Install the `GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain` from the [official website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
 - For uploading firmware to your Riotee device install the [riotee-probe](https://github.com/NessieCircuits/Riotee_ProbeSoftware) Python package globally with

```bash
pipx install riotee-probe
```

## Usage

Take a look at the [examples](./examples) for how you can use this SDK. We also provide a [template project](https://github.com/NessieCircuits/Riotee_AppTemplate) to get you started with your first Riotee project using the SDK.

In a nutshell: Your application must provide a Makefile that includes the [SDK's Makefile](./Makefile) and defines the following variables:

 - `RIOTEE_SDK_ROOT`: Path to the Riotee SDK
 - `SRC_FILES`: Your C/C++ source files
 - `INC_DIRS`: Paths to your header files
 - `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path where project is built
 - `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT`: Optional. Path to your gcc toolchain if not on your *Path*.
 - `LIB_DIRS`: Optional. Paths to static libraries.
 - `LIB_FILES`: Optional. Static libraries to link against. 

 Your code defines a `main()` function. This function is executed while the device has energy and suspended when energy becomes critically low. If the power supply is interrupted, the stack and all static and global variables are stored in non-volatile memory and restored as soon as the supply comes back.

There are a number of callbacks that your application can implement:
 - `startup_callback()`: Called right after every reset. Perform early stage initizialization required for low-power operation here
 - `reset_callback()`: Called later after every reset. Initialize peripherals here.
 - `suspend_callback()`: Called right before the application gets suspended. Abort any energy-intensive operation immediately.
 - `resume_callback()`: Called right after the application gets resumed.


Your application may change the default size of the memory that is retained across power failures as well as the stack size by defining `RIOTEE_RAM_RETAINED_SIZE` and `RIOTEE_STACK_SIZE` in the Makefile.
For an example, take a look at the [dsp example's Makefile](./examples/dsp/Makefile).
