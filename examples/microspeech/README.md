# Microspeech Example

Demonstrates usage of VM1010 microphone and TensorFlow Light for Microcontrollers library.

You'll need a Riotee Board, a Sensor Shield, a Capacitor Shield and an energy harvester. The example should work with all MLCCs on the Capacitor Shield activated, i.e. 3x47uF and 3x220uF.
