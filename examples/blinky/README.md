# Blinky Example

Switches on the built-in LED when the capacitor is fully charged.
Switches off the LED in the `suspend()` that is called when the capacitor voltage gets critically low.

Run the example and observe how the blinking pattern changes with changes in the energy availability, for example, when moving around a solar powered device.

If you run this example on a Riotee Board and have a Riotee Capacitor shield, you can also experiment with different capacitor sizes.
