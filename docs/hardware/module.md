# Riotee Module

Our Riotee Module is the heart of the product line. It integrates energy harvesting, energy storage, power management, non-volatile memory, a powerful Cortex-M4 processor, and a 2.4-GHz, BLE-compatible radio into a tiny module with the footprint of a postage stamp. The Module can be soldered onto a PCB with any standard soldering iron or by reflow soldering. Thanks to the standard 0.1" pitch, it's also possible to mount some pin headers and plug the Module into a breadboard.

A Maxim MAX20361 boost charger regulates the voltage of an attached harvester using Maximum Power Point tracking and charges the on-board capacitors. The boost converter can be configured over an I2C interface. The buck regulator outputs a constant 2V supply voltage. Two independent comparators continuously monitor the capacitor voltage against two software-controlled voltage thresholds.

The module has two microcontrollers: The Nordic Semiconductor nRF52833 has a 64-MHz Cortex-M4 CPU with floating point unit and a low-power 2.4GHz wireless radio. The TI MSP430FR5962 has 128kB non-volatile FRAM. Both controllers can be programmed by the user and share access to all other components of the system. For example, the buffered capacitor voltage is available on the ADC inputs of both controllers. The controllers are connected to each other with a 4-wire SPI bus plus an additional handshake line. This system architecture supports different configurations: The software provided by the Riotee SDK runs application and networking code on the nRF52833 microcontroller and uses the MSP430FR as an SPI-based non-volatile RAM to retain application state across power outages. Other users may prefer running application code directly on the MSP430FR controller and using the nRF52833 as an SPI-controlled radio.

## Internal Pin Map

Most signals on the Riotee Module are shared between the MSP430 and the nRF52 so either of the two controllers can access the peripherals like RTC, boost converter and threshold network.
Additionally, the two controllers are connected with five signals, supporting 4-wire SPI plus an additional handshake line.
The table below shows the complete signal mapping on the Riotee Module.

## Soldering

The Riotee Module can be soldered onto a PCB manually or in an automated reflow process.
For reflow soldering, we recommend a standard lead free process with a peak temperature of 260° Celsius.
The pads on the bottom of the module can only be connected via reflow soldering and require special attention:
If applying paste with a stencil, use a stencil with a thickness of at least 100um, preferably more.
When using a solder paste printer, you may need to increase the default amount of paste for these pads by up to 50%.

## Programming

For programming the nRF52 and MSP430FR on-board the module, use the {doc}`/hardware/probe`.
Connect ground and *VccTarget* on the probe to *+2V* on the Riotee Module.
For programming the nRF52, connect *SwdClk* and *SwdIO* between the probe and the module.
For programming the MSP430, connect *SbwClk* and *SbwIO* between the probe and the module.

Install the `riotee-probe` Python package with

```bash
pipx install riotee-probe
```

Flash new firmware with

```bash
riotee-probe program -d nrf52 -f firmware_nrf52.hex
```

and 

```bash
riotee-probe program -d msp430 -f firmware_msp430.hex
```

## LED

The Riotee Module has a red LED connected to *P0.03* of the nRF52 and *PJ.0* of the MSP430FR.
Set the pin high to switch on the LED.

## Capacitor Voltage Monitoring

The capacitor voltage is divided down with a voltage divider and made available to the system via an op-amp buffer as *VcapMon*.

```{math}
VcapMon=\frac{5.62}{15.62}Vcap
```

*VcapMon* is connected to ADC channel AIN5 on the nRF52 and ADC channel A17 on the MSP430.

## Power Switches

```{image} img/power_switches.svg
:width: 50%
:align: center
```

There are two power switches between the output of the buck regulator and the other parts of the system.
One switch is controlled by the *Bypass* signal and allows rerouting current through an external amperemeter to measure the dynamic power consumption of the module.
When setting high pin *Bypass*, the switch opens and current can be measured with an amperemeter connected between *+2V (Aon)* and *Vshunt*.
See also [here](measuring_current).

The other switch is controlled by the AM1805 RTC.
It allows entering an ultra-low power mode where all components are switched off except for the RTC.
This reduces current consumption on the +2V supply to <45nA.
For details, refer to the [AM1805 datasheet](https://www.solid-run.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=imx8:carrierboard:docs:sr-imx8m-carrierboard-onboard-rtc.pdf).
