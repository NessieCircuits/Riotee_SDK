# Riotee Capacitor Shield


Our Capacitor Shield allows you to add more capacitance to your device. The capacitors on-board the Riotee module are sufficient for many applications, but some require more in order to, for example, send a large wireless packet. The Capacitor Shield includes an eight-position switch that allows you to connect additional capacitors ranging from tiny ceramics to large supercapacitors.

## Features & Specifications

- 3x 47uF MLCCs, 3x 220uF MLCCs, 1x 10mF EDLC, and 1x 220mF EDLC
- Eight-position DIP switch for selectively connecting the capacitors
