# Battery-free basics

The harvested energy is often unreliable and insufficient to power such a device directly.
To remain operable, it will accumulate energy in tiny, sustainable capacitors.
When those capacitors are charged, the device will activate and function until its capacitors are drained, at which point it will turn off until it has gathered enough energy to resume operation.
Riotee's hardware-and-software solution automatically handles this *intermittent execution* so you can focus on building your application.
